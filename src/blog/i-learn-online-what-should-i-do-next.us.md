Objective: There is a big segment of our audience that already did some online courses, some of them even did a full-stack web development online bootcamp on treehouse or bloc. We need an articule to guide them into their firsts months as a developer. Is a big problem for them because maybe they did not find a job yet and they think they need to keep adding more technologies to their stack of skills to acomplish that. The way to go is not to ass more skills, but to start working on a real job, that way your skills will be evolving based on the market needs, and also because experience is way more appreciated than knowledge.
