      I was almost leaving my career behind, not even seeing clear goals for me, and then 
      I had this great opportunity to join this community of knowledge and on top of anything 
      else great humans!... I was able to commit to something very interesting with never ending options 
      to make my career as a graphic designer more powerful without leaving my life, with a 
      perfect part-time cohort... I 
      take with me after this experience all kinds of tools i learned there along my way, 
      knowing that i can always go back and keep growing at 4geeks.

      I love 4Geeks Academy's approach to teaching students. There are always 3 tutors who will 
      make sure you master your skills and will not give up on you if there's something 
      you don't understand. They never leave my questions unanswered, regardless how obvious 
      they may seem. And just the atmosphere in the school is very warm.
      I'm grateful to you guys for providing 24 hour access to school, 
      so we can work any time that is convenient for us. Thank you, 4Geeks!!

      I've been learning how to code by myself for 4 years, mostly HTML, CSS and PHP. 
      I've been struggling a lot trying to make a dynamic website, so I started to look 
      for a coding school in Miami and I found the best one: 4Geeks Academy. And thanks to 
      the program they offer, the Income Sharing Agreement, I could enroll right away and pay once I get a job

      Overall just a great group of people with a common goal. I came into 4Geeks with little 
      to no knowledge about coding and after 16 weeks I was building projects I could have never 
      imagined I would be able to build. They will provide you with the knowledge and tools to 
      become a successful developer ready for hire.... Ask as many questions 
      as you need and they will be happy to help. Not to mention the lifetime support you get 
      even after completing the Bootcamp.

      I highly recommend this coding boot camp!!!! Before 4Geeks I never had any experience with 
      code I didn't know where to start and within 10 weeks I was able to grasp the core concepts 
      of being a developer. The staff and Mentors are awesome... enroll today if u want to go from 
      zero to hero in 10 weeks and start developing your own apps.

      This program was definitely one of the hardest things I've done in my life. It was 16 weeks of 
      constant work and practice. All things in life worth having is not going to be easily obtained. 
      If you can stick with it and follow what the teachers are teaching you, you will succeed.

      the professors have been a great help along the process. I would recommend this Bootcamp to 
      everyone.

      My experience on 4Geeks Academy was and is the best. The instructors and TAs will help you in 
      a blink. 4Geeks' Slack should be renamed to 4Geeks Overflow. The response time is fast. The 
      responses are strong and different solutions are provided. If you have an interview and you 
      want to refresh your knowledge or exercise do not hesitate to go to 4Geeks, you will find 
      someone ready to help you...
