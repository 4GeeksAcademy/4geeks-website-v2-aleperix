      I've been learning how to code by myself for 4 years, mostly HTML, CSS and PHP. 
      I've been struggling a lot trying to make a dynamic website, so I started to look 
      for a coding school in Miami and I found the best one: 4Geeks Academy. And thanks to 
      the program they offer, the Income Sharing Agreement, I could enroll right away and pay once I get a job"
