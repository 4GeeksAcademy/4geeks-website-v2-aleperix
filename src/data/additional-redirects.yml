# BEWARE!
# These redirect are just the aditional ones, this file should not grow that much

# 1. If you are planning to redirect to the page go to data/page/<page-name>.yml instead 
#    and look for the meta_info.redirects array

# 2. If you are planning to redirect to an entity like courses, locations, events, etc. 
#    Go to data/<entity-type>/<file>.<lang>.yml instead and look for the meta_info.redirects

# 3. If none of your redirects apply to entities or pages you can put them here:

redirects:
  - fromPath: "/talent"
    toPath: "https://www.notion.so/4geeksacademy/Talent-Pipeline-4Geeks-Academy-ef91aba17f9c4964bf7972396d190bdf"
    #redirectInBrowser: true
    isPermanent: false # if permanent google will erase the original url from its results
