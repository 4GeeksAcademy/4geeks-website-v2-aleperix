  - question: "Do I HAVE to bring my own laptop?"
    answer: "Absolutely, unequivocally, the answer is:  YES.  Bring your laptop EVERY SINGLE TIME.  We do not require a specific OS, and, since all of our coding lessons and practices are cloud-based, you can even use a Chromebook."
  - question: "Is 4Geeks a licensed/accredited academic institution?"
    answer: "For sure! We are licensed (not accredited) in Florida by the Commission for Independent Education of the Florida Department of Education. "
  - question: "What is a typical class day like?"
    answer: |-
      Our course offers classes 3 times per week, 3 hours per day.  Normally, you may want to grab a coffee on your way in (Starthub coffee is a must!) and arrive early to chat with both your mentors and your peer programmers.
      Our ‚ÄúFlipped Classroom‚Äù means that you MUST come to class having previously read the required material; having watched the required videos; and having practiced a couple of exercises.  We know that your time is ‚Äúgold,‚Äù so we must take advantage of every available moment that you have while you are in front of us.
      After the ‚Äúclassic 15 minutes to get settled in,‚Äù we begin by reviewing the content for that specific class.  Your mentors will clarify any and all questions/doubts you may have, and they will thoroughly explain how the coding content of the day works ‚Äì providing relevant examples as to how the day‚Äôs coding lesson will be integral to your new coding lifestyle.
      Next, we start coding.  Generally, there are one or two exercises or mini-projects that we will complete during each class.  ‚ÄúAwareness‚Äù becomes ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù after you have practiced and reviewed a specific topic several times.
      By the end of the class, your mentors will guide you through the next assignments.  You will be informed of what you will need to study, watch, and practice for the subsequent class.  Also, there will always be time to resolve any last-minute issues with your code; your mentors will always try to help you reach your particular goal."
  - question: "How many hours a week do I need to have available?"
    answer: |-
      "This is a ‚Äúpart-time‚Äù program.  The in-house classes will require 9 hours every week.  However, in order to make you the BEST POSSIBLE developer, we need for you to commit an additional 10 hours from your end, resulting in approximately 20 hours each week.  Sorry, there is no other way to get you to where you desire to be.  If you don‚Äôt complete the exercises, you will be behind.  Plus, this is the ONLY way we can make sure that you gather the skills needed to become a developer.
      We have built an online LMS (Learning Machine System) that includes: exercises, videos, tutorials, cheat sheets, individually customized profile, gamified learning and evaluations, text, readings, recommended books, lessons, infographics, and so much more.
      Do you recall us mentioning that we are instilling a new framework in the world of Coding Education?  Okay, well, we are SERIOUS about doing so.  From day one, you will have to reach deep within yourself and get ready to learn in a new, challenging way.  But, we are here for you ‚Äì REALLY HERE FOR YOU ‚Äì with both online and offline access to both our Mentors and Communications platforms.  We are committed to training you as a Developer, and we will do this TOGETHER."
  - question: "Why Javascript?"
    answer: |-
      "This question should be asked the other way around ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy NOT JavaScript?‚Äù  Because there are no other alternatives ‚Äì JavaScript ‚Äúowns‚Äù the web; it is the only language all web browsers understand, AND, it is STILL growing like crazy.
      JavaScript is the most used coding language in the world; every website needs it, and it is the most demanded language by companies by ten times the next.  It is just the way it has to be."
  - question: "Why Python?"
    answer: |-
      "Python is the fastest growing language in the wealthiest countries.  It is widely used in virtually every industry and has top-quality libraries for all fields growing to be ‚Äúthe future‚Äù:  Web, AI, Robotics, Big Data, etc.  According to MIT Professors, it is the essential programming language to learn.  Go ahead and take a look for yourself here.
      It has to be Python.  You will find more job opportunities; you will learn to code, and it will help you with other back-end languages and frameworks.  Even Google endorsed python and has incorporated it everywhere!"
  - question: "Why not Node JS?"
    answer: |-
      "Node is amazing.  It challenges the way the web is created.  However, only 0.3% of the web has adopted Node JS, and its growth has slowed even further over the last months.  Python, Java, PHP, and other similar languages still rule the world (and that is not going to change anytime soon).  They work in a very different way than Node does; our purpose is to prepare you for the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù  We train our Full-Stack Developers using/teaching only the most standard and professional technologies.
      Here you can find a great argument as to why we are not teaching Node JS."
  - question: "Why 4Geeks Academy?"
    answer: |-
      "Well, it IS kind of weird to speak greatly about oneself‚Ä¶but, okay, since you asked!
      Premium Coding Education + Part-time + From as low as $135 per month.
      We also offer a unique methodology in which we will enhance your overall capabilities; we will train you and we will make a software developer out of you.  We are constantly providing innovative new approaches to teaching coding that not many other educational organizations are doing.
      We ‚ÄúBreathe Coding.‚Äù  That is our motto, because we understand that, in order to become a developer, one has to become part of the coding culture.
      One of the greatest things about 4Geeks Academy is the gamification behind our curriculum.  We‚Äôve made learning fun and we have mastered the art of showing how coding skills can fit into everyday life.
      There are others echoing this‚Ä¶you can watch them here."
  - question: "Why ‚ÄúPart-time?‚Äù How does it work?"
    answer: |-
      "We believe that the future of education is ‚Äúpart-time.‚Äù
      What we provide is a blended education leveraging two proven formats:  Part-time Training and Flipped Classroom.  The methodology combines a mixture of the following four cornerstones:
      Flipped Classroom: Theory is delivered through video, animation, images, and infographics.  Class time is then used to debate, create and build projects, and mentor over practical exercises.
      One-on-One Weekly Mentorship: Every student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a Senior Mentor on a regular basis.
      1:7 Mentor-Student Ratio: An intimate setting provides our faculty with the opportunity to adapt to each student‚Äôs particular pace.
      Talent Tree:  The syllabus maps out 44 skills in which students earn points towards each skill learned in a gamified fashion."
  - question: "How do I pay for my tuition?"
    answer: |-
      "You have several options.  Our tuition fee for the Full Stack Development program is $7499.  There are no other fees, hidden charges, or anything else.  Just $7499 for a 16-week coding program in Miami. Or $9499 for a 09 weeks Full-time program.
      Furthermore, we have also worked (together with amazing partners) on offering you an Extended Payment Plan as an option.  You can now apply for either a 6, 12, or 24-month plan in order to lower the up-front cost and, most importantly, get the education that you need.  There is no other offer like this in Miami.

  - question: "What is the difference between the Full Stack Development program and the Website Program at Miami Dade College?"
    answer: |-
      "We love this question.  Basically, we are in charge of both of them. üòä
      In the Website program at Miami Dade College, you will learn both how to code and how to build websites.  The syllabus for this program includes: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, API‚Äôs, and more.
      Now, the Full Stack Development program is designed in four seasons:
      Pre-Work + Learn to Code + Build Websites + Build Web Applications
      It also has additional features:
      It is 16 weeks long at includes over 300 hours of learning
      The stack of technologies here are: JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Python, Django, API‚Äôs, AJAX, SASS, HTML, CSS, and more
      There are plenty of payment opportunities with our Extended Payment Plan
      We will guide you and help you find a job after the course though our Placement Program
      You will have access for one year to both our academic and exercises platforms (4Geeks Academy LMS: Breath Code Platform
      You will be able to create and build websites, but you will attain the skills and tools to tackle more challenging projects such as: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Augmented Reality, to name a few (no one else in Miami is teaching new coders these skills)"
  - question: "Do I get a job after completing the program?"
    answer: |-
      "This is the part where everyone pays attention‚Ä¶we cannot guarantee that you will get a job after completion of our course.  
      Nobody can, actually.  However, by enrolling in our program, you will have access to our Advisors and Partners.  You will be part of a new network and we will be both helping you and guiding you throughout the job-seeking process."
  - question: "Extended Payment Plan? How does it work? What does that mean?"
    answer: |-
      "The Extended Payment Plan has been designed specifically for OUR students.  The average tuition fee for a coding program in the U.S. is about $11,000.  YES, that is $5,000 more than what we charge.  Again, YES, that is 83% more expensive than us.
      But, wait‚Ä¶not only do we offer the best price in town ($6,000 for the entire course), we ALSO offer the best payment plan in Miami.  You can apply for either a 6, 12, or 24-month extended payment plan.  You can pay only $240 per month (plus a $1,000 deposit) for 24 months, and you will become a developer in 16 weeks.

      Now, if you wish to begin your application, click here."
  - question: "Do I graduate as a 'Senior Developer?'"
    answer: |-
      "Nope.  Please don‚Äôt run before you learn to walk.  Coding is just like life:  if you are good at it, you will learn faster, but you will not learn instantly.  You will get the experience to see all the details once you have mastered the art.
      Taking our Full Stack program means that your life will have a new skill, but you will also develop a brand-new way of ‚Äúthinking.‚Äù  You will graduate as a ‚ÄúJunior Developer‚Äù ‚Äì but as a REALLY GOOD ‚ÄúJunior Developer‚Äù ‚Äì not just another in the bunch!"
  - question: "What is your schedule? "
    answer: |-
      "It‚Äôs actually really easy:
      Mondays, Wednesdays & Fridays
      From 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm
      Mandatory attendance (To graduate you will need to have a minimum 80% attendance)
      16 weeks
  - question: "How do I apply?"
    answer: |-
      "To begin your career as a Developer, you only need to click here and fill out a very simple form.  We will take care of the rest. "

      "Once you begin the application process, you will receive an email from one of our Student Counselors.  We will guide you throughout the process.  Simply reply to our email and we shall give you a call at your convenience.
      After the phone call, you will be invited to a personal meeting.  You will be able to visit our location, meet the team, and get to know us.  During the meeting, you can explain to us why you wish to become a developer.  We will take care of everything."
  - question: "Do I need any coding experience to enroll in the program?"
    answer: |-
      "No.  You just need to want to learn.  Coding must exist in some part of your body, and we will find it!  If you already know how to open a browser and check your Facebook, then we‚Äôll be fine!"
  - question: "What is the market like for companies seeking developers?"
    answer: |-
      "There are over FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND (500,000) open coding jobs in the United States alone.  We have over 25,000 open positions in Florida alone, and university graduates equate to only 2,000 annually.  The gap is HUGE‚Ä¶and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that it will grow by 24% by 2020."
  - question: "Why Miami?"
    answer: |-
      "Miami. No longer a city known just for tourism, parties, and an extravagant lifestyle; Miami is becoming a place where technology and the startup ecosystem is growing faster than those of any other city in the US.
      According to a Careerbliss study published in Forbes, Miami is the happiest city to live, and according to CNN, software development is the best profession in America. Can you imagine having both?
      Here are more details of what we think about Learning to Code in Miami."
  - question: "Who is that face in the Logo?"
    answer: |-
      "Oh, you mean Rigoberto?  He is the heart and spirit of everyone working for the Academy."
